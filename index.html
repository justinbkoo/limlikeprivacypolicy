<p class="title">LimLike’s Privacy Policy</p>
<p>LimLike is an mobile phone app providing users of Instagram to send or receieve "LimLikes" on their own or followers' Instagram media. (the “Services”).</p>
<p>This Privacy Policy describes how and when LimLike collects, uses and shares your information when you use our Services.  LimLike receives your information through the <a href="https://www.instagram.com/developer/">Instagram API</a>.  For example, you send us information when you use the LimLike app.  When using any of our Services you consent to the collection, transfer, manipulation, storage, disclosure and other uses of your information as described in this Privacy Policy. Irrespective of which country you reside in or supply information from, you authorize LimLike to use your information in Hong Kong and any other country where LimLike is available.</p>
<p>If you have any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer of LimLike at <a href="mailto:bjustinkoo@gmail.com">bjustinkoo@gmail.com</a>.</p>

<p class="title">Information Collection and Use</p>
<p>We collect and use your information below to provide our Services and to measure and improve our Services from time to time.</p>
<p>User Info, User Media, Public Content &amp; Followers: Our Services are primarily designed to provide a simple "interface" to the user's Instagram account while supplying a "LimLike" system that is not affiliated with Instagram in any shape or form. Most of the information you provide us is used to create the aforementioned "interface" to your Instagram account. This includes a display of your most recent media and followers' most recent media on Instagram. Our default setting is almost always to make the information you provide viewable only by user of the LimLike app for as long as you do not delete it from Instagram. Specifically, the app stores only the user ID, media IDs, and "LimLike" allocation data in an external database powered by Google Firebase. Our Services do not disseminate your public information to any third party.</p>

<p><span class="title">Location Information</span>: The LimLike app does not retrieve, store, nor use the geographic location of the device from where it is used</p>

<p><span class="title">Cookies</span>:  For an extra layer of security, upon "logging in with Instagram" with the LimLike app, which uses an in-app web browser, cookies for that browser are immediately deleted upon a successful login. Therefore the LimLike app does not "save" a users' Instagram credentials and upon restarting the app, the credentials must be reentered.</p>

<p><span class="title">Google Analytics</span>: We will also install Google Analytics in the LimLike app to collect your behaviors in using our Services. We may also recommend some other services that may be suitable or appeal to you based on our analysis.</p>

<p><span class="title">Log Data</span>: The LimLike app does not retrieve, store, nor use information ("Log Data") such as your IP address, device information (including device and application IDs) and search terms.</p>

<p><span class="title">Information Sharing and Disclosure</span><br>
    We do not ever disclose your private personal information.</p>

<p><span class="title">Changes to this Policy</span><br>
    We may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time. The most current version of the policy will govern our use of your information and will always be at <a href="https://www.justinbkoo.github.io/limlikeprivacypolicy">https://www.justinbkoo.github.io/limlikeprivacypolicy</a>. If we make a change to this policy that, in our sole discretion, is material, we will update <a href="https://www.justinbkoo.github.io/limlikeprivacypolicy">https://www.justinbkoo.github.io/limlikeprivacypolicy</a>. By continuing to access or use the Services after those changes become effective, you agree to be bound by the revised Privacy Policy.</p>

<p>Effective: 9th September 2017</p>
